# Customer_data_AD
The project uses a .csv file of customer information, such as age, time on site, general Internet usage, including whether or not they clicked on an ad.
The .ipynb file contains analysis of this data as well as a prediction model of whether a click will be made using the existing data and Logistic regression algorithm.
Thanks, Jose Portilla, for setting the assignment!
